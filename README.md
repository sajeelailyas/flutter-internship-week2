### Introduction

A simple counter app built with Flutter that saves the counter value even after the app is closed using `SharedPreferences`.


### Features

* Increment and decrement buttons
* Reset to zero
* Persistent counter value saved locally
* Minimal and clean UI with soft colors


### Tech Stack

* Flutter
* Dart
* SharedPreferences package
* Stateful Widgets


### Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajeelailyas/flutter-counter-app.git  
cd flutter-counter-app  
flutter pub get  
flutter run  
```


### Usage
